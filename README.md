Scripts and settings

I am currently debugging these scripts. When I have them debugged, I only will try to maintain the mindmeld setup script and the python environment setup script. The ssh script is only to be maintained by Jude (the original creator of some of these scripts) if he chooses to do so.

These scripts are intended to setup mindmeld, direnv and pyenv in linux and mac environemnts. They can be ran by copying both the mindmeld setup script and the python environment setup script to the directory in which you want your mindmeld workspace, running chmod +x *scriptname* for both scripts and running the mindmeld setup script`
